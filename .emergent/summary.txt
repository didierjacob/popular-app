The user requested a series of significant enhancements for the Popular mobile application. The initial request was to implement a Boost Myself feature, allowing users to spend credits to add themselves as a new personality in the app.

Following this, the user made several iterative requests:
1.  Visually distinguish real personalities from those added by users via the Boost Myself feature.
2.  Initially requested to improve, then to completely remove, a predictions chart feature.
3.  Create a comprehensive admin interface to monitor app statistics and manually boost votes. Access to this interface was to be hidden behind a secret gesture.
4.  Refine the admin vote-boosting feature to allow precise control over the number of likes/dislikes added.
5.  Further expand the admin interface with features for moderation, real-time activity tracking, and global app settings.
6.  Secure the admin interface with a single, custom password.
7.  Integrate Google Trends to automatically identify and highlight trending personalities on the home screen.
8.  Automate the Google Trends data refresh on a daily basis.
9.  Finally, the user asked what was needed to deploy the app, and then requested to begin the first phase of deployment, starting with the creation of marketing screenshots.
